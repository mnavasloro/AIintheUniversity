  <h4>About the workshop</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body"> 
  
  <p>We have been hearing for several months that AI is going to end jobs and education as we know it: listening to how we are warned about the use of ChatGPT by students to cheat on assignments, hearing anecdotes of people who use it for their work but don't talk about it because it seems that it is lazy to use it, or it is simply frowned upon. AI is a tool that will bring about many changes, not all of them good, but not all of them bad either. Just as it seems absurd now that someone would have tried to stop the internet and not take advantage of the good things it brought, it is equally important that we try to take advantage of the good things about AI, and for that we need to know about it. In this workshop, we will briefly introduce what generative AIs are: nothing technical, just what they can do and what they can't do, as well as phrases that are often heard about AI (mainly their limitations, challenges and possible problems they can cause) to see if they are clearer by the end of the session. Different use cases will be presented, and a brainstorming will take place so people can solve their doubts and share experiences on AI for teaching.</p>
 
 <p>
  The objectives of the session are:
<ul>
    <li> To identify the main challenges that the Artificial Intelligence has already brought to the University (e.g., students using ChatGPT for writing their essays).</li>
    <li> To detect opportunities new techologies will offer to us (e.g. more customized learning for students).</li>
    <li> To share proposals or ideas that different colleages might have implemented (or intend to do) in their Universities in order to overcome challenges and seize opportunities.</li>
    <li> Present the novel pluralistic and multidisciplinary format devised for the EELISA spring school “Ethos+Tekhne”.</li>
</ul> 
The expected outcomes will be:

<ul>
    <li> To learn the problems that have appeared in different universities, so we can better recognize them when they appear in our own.</li>
    <li> To learn opportunities we might not have thought about.</li>
    <li> To discuss and improve proposals in order to overcome challenges and seize opportunities, making the most of Artificial Intelligence. </li>
    <li> To obtain feedback from participants on Ethos-Tekhne format, upcoming improvements and future directions.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>FIRST PART OF THE SESSION - Workshop</b></h4>


<ul>
<li> <b>Short introduction presenting AI</b> (10-15 minutes, María Navas-Loro)
<br>We will briefly introduce what generative AIs are: nothing technical, just what they can do and what they can't do, as well as phrases that are often heard about AI (mainly their limitations, challenges and possible problems they can cause) to see if they are clearer by the end of the session.</li>
<li> <b>Example of use case: Ethos+Tekhne</b>  (40 min, Stefano Vrizzi, Stefano Tramacere, Alberto Vergani, Giovanna Failla)</li>

<ul>
<li> Presentation of the Ethos+Tekhne school: 20 min</li>
<li> Q & A (5 min)</li>
<li> Discussion on topics/logistics (10 min)</li>
<li> Wrap up (5 min).</li>
</ul> 
<li> <b>Presentation of other use cases</b> (10-20 min each, around)
<br>
Experiences of teachers or students using AI tools to learn or teach in the teaching environment: how to save time in tedious tasks, how to make learning more accessible to students, how to prevent the student from just copying what ChatGPT tells them... also the insight from students are welcome!</li>
</ul> 

<br>

<h4><b>SECOND PART OF THE SESSION - Brainstorming</b></h4>
Together with the presenters of the previous session and the attendees, we will try to extract lessons learned from the use cases of the first part of the session: we will discuss possible initiatives to take advantage of these tools, and we will solve any doubts raised about them. The aim is for attendees to see AI as tools to be used, and to consider how students can use them, for better and for worse. We will end the session with a recap of the lessons learned and a list of possible actions to make the most of AI (how to design activities with students to make the most of it, for example, or how to use it to save time in the most repetitive teaching/learning tasks).
Topics to discuss (time for each topic may vary, around 10min each). Comments are questions can be done raising the hand or anonymously using tools such as <a href="https://www.mentimeter.com/">Mentimeter</a>:
<ul>
<li> Solving doubts about AI tools: people can freely ask/answer questions.</li>
<li> Discussing main fears of professors and how to tackle them: we will collect main fears.</li>
<li> How students are using these tools and if they help them or not in their learning.</li>
<li> How to use the tools to save time regarding repetitive tasks.
The whole experience will be collected in order to create a list of possible actions and recommendations to make the most of AI could be spread and used across the EELISA alliance.</li>
<li> Establishment of collaboration network within EELISA to collect examples and update this list. A new community can be created to this aim, as well as new events (e.g. workshops/schools to involve more members).</li>
</ul>
